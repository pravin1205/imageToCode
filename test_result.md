# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

SOLUTION: Completely rewritten preview system to use script tag approach - component code is now stored in a plain text script tag and retrieved via textContent to avoid template literal injection issues.

    message: "CRITICAL JSX TRANSFORMATION FIX IMPLEMENTED: User reported persistent 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token <'' in console logs despite previous markdown cleanup fixes. Root cause identified: eval() was executing raw JSX code before Babel could transform it. SOLUTION: Complete restructure of iframe JSX handling - removed problematic eval() approach, embedded component code directly in type='text/babel' script tag, improved React imports setup before transformation, enhanced component detection after Babel processing, added better fallback mechanisms with informative messages. Now Babel properly transforms JSX syntax before execution instead of trying to execute raw JSX. This should eliminate the syntax errors causing blank preview. Frontend services restarted successfully. Ready for user manual testing."

    message: "INITIALIZATION COMPLETE: Successfully analyzed existing Vision-to-Code Generator app. Key findings: (1) Backend has Gemini 2.5 Flash integration with all APIs working, (2) Frontend has complete workflow including upload, preview, and chat, (3) Live preview system has been extensively debugged and fixed for JSX transformation issues, (4) All dependencies are installed. Current app supports: screenshot upload → technology selection (React/Vue/Angular/Svelte/HTML) → manual code generation → live preview with responsive tabs → chat interface for adjustments. Ready to implement multi-AI model integration and preview enhancements as requested."
